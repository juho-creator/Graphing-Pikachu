Interactive Pikachu Graph
=============

I created an interactive graph of pikachu and pokeball floating on water using various graphs!
The pikachu, pokeball and water is made interactive to make it even better!

# Creation Process 

## Pikachu
Creating the Pikachu took a very long time because I used so many different equations to trace each parts of Pikachu.
<br />

**Step 1 :** I added a png of Pikachu on desmos. 
<br />
<br />


**Step 2 :** Created a parabolic equation with a variable constants A,B, and C for controlling concavity, X and Y 
position of the graph to trace certain parts of pikachu. The following parabolic equation was used : $Y = A((X - B)^2) + C$
<br />
<br />


**Step 3 :** Once the graph matched with the picture, unnecessary parts of the graph were removed using domains and range.<br />

<br />
<br />


**Step 4 :**  If certain parts weren't covered by parabolic equation, other equations were used(Circles,Ellipse,log, Exponential,Cubic,Square root)<br />

<br />
<br />


**Step 5 :** Step 1~4 was repeated to create Pikachu
<br />
<br />

**Step 6 :** Finally, two slider variables were included on every partial equations of Pikachu for controlling the horizontal and vertical position of the entire Pikachu<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## PokeBall
Creating pokeball was simple because all I needed was a horizontal asymptote and two circles 
<br />

**Step 1 :** Created equation template for the circle $(X-A)^2+(Y-B)^2=C^2$
<br />
<br />

**Step 2 :**  Adjusted the size of the two circle<br />

<br />
<br />


**Step 3 :** Created 2 horizontal asymptote, each with different domains for the 2 lines in the middle of the pokeball.<br />

<br />
<br />

**Step 4 :** Two slider variables were included on each equations for controlling horizontal and vertical position of the Pokeball.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Water 
Creating the water equation was fairly easy because I only used sinusoidal equation with inequality. However coming up with the various interactive features on the sinusoidal wave was confusing. 

**Step 1:** Sinusoidal function with inequality was combined to create the affect of having a wave like form filled with blue colors under the graph just like water.

<br />
<br />


**Step 2:** 4 slider variables were added to control the water waves.<br />

# Control Settings
You can play around with the settings for water, pikachu and the Pokeball. 
The control settings are in the **Water_Control, Pikachu_Control and Pokeball_Control** respectively.
<br />
<br />


### Pikachu_Control :
**P_Horizontal** : horizontal position of Pikachu
<br />

**P_Vertical** : vertical position of Pikachu
<br />
<br />


### Pokeball_Control: 
**B_Horizontal** : horizontal position of four people
<br />

**B_Vertical** : vertical position of pokeball
<br />
<br />


### Water_Control :
**W_Flow** : Enables water animation<br />
**W_Amp** : Wave amplitude<br />
**W_freq** : Frequency of wave <br />
**W_Level** : Water level<br />

# Graph components
Graph functions for each components are in the following folders :

### 1.Pikachu
Pikachu is made up of 
* Circles (9)
* parabola (9)
* Ellipse (2)
* log (2)
* Exponential (1)
* Cubic (1)
* Square root (1)  
<br />
<br />
